Static electricity accumulation in dry indoor environments causes discomfort, damage to
sensitive electronics, and poses safety risks in industrial settings. This paper presents a novel
solution: an Active Electrostatic Neutralization System (AENS) that uses controlled
ionization and real-time environmental monitoring to mitigate static charge buildup. The
proposed system leverages advanced humidity control, electrostatic sensors, and ionizing
emitters to maintain optimal charge balance, thereby addressing an unsolved issue in
everyday life.
